        <b>Affiliate Relationship Disclosure & Disclaimer</b><br>
            <br>
            My NUMBER #1 priority is to provide you with outstanding money-saving deals and opportunities and, in some way, to add value to your life and to the lives of those whom you love and care about. To accomplish this goal, I spend time researching and validating deals and offerings. Some deals involve products or services sold by merchants that have affiliate programs. If I find a product or service, which I believe is a “great deal,” I have no issue referring you to the product or service with an affiliate link. Hip2Save may also allow third-party merchants to place text links, graphic buttons and/or banner ads on Hip2Save. I might get paid a commission if you use the link and/or buy the product. Sometimes I receive reward points, free samples, or some other incentive. Whether you use the link or buy the product is entirely up to you. I welcome your comments on a deal (thumbs up or thumbs down) and appreciate the time you spend with me on Hip2Save.<br>
            <br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            <br>
            Collin Morgan<br>
