priority is to provide you with outstanding money-saving deals and
opportunities and, in some way, to add value to your life and to the lives of
those whom you love and care about. To accomplish this goal, I spend time each
day researching and validating deals and offerings. Some deals involve products
or services sold by merchants that have affiliate programs. If I find a product
or service, which I believe is a “great deal,” I have no issue referring you to
the product or service with an affiliate link. Hip2Save may also allow
third-party merchants to place text links, graphic buttons and/or banner ads on
the Application. I might get paid a commission if you use the link and/or buy
the product. Sometimes I receive reward points, free samples, or some other
incentive. Whether you use the link or buy the product is entirely up to you. I
welcome your comments on a deal (thumbs up or thumbs down) and appreciate the
time you spend with me on Hip2Save. Sincerely, Collin Morgan</span></em></p>
